# Power BI Utils

## About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of Power BI utilities that I have been developing and curating throughout my journey with Power BI applications. This repository aims to centralize my Power Query code snippets, DAX formulas, JSON templates, and other Power BI features.

## How to Use
1. Copy the code from the text file.
2. In Power Query, navigate to: **Home > New Source > Blank Query > Advanced Editor**. Paste the code and click 'Done'.
3. Rename your table, and you're all set!
